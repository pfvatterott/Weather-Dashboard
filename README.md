# Weather Dashboard

## Description

For this project I used JQuery, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create a responsive and intuitive weather dashboard.

Here are some key features:
1. A current weather dashboard that shows the city, the day, current description and icon, the temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind speed, and UV-Index.
2. A UV-Index that changes color depending the severity.
3. A five day forecast that shows the day of the week, a descriptive icon, the temperature, humidity, and precipitation.
4. A search bar where the user can search for cities to look up the weather.
5. A list of cities that is generated from the user's searches.
6. If the user enters an incorrect city an error message appears and the incorrect city is not added to the list.
7. Local storage that remembers the inputted cities and displays them when the user reloads the page.
8. The format of the page is reoriented if using a smaller screen.
9. If no local storage is available upon reload the application defaults to New York City.
